This program creates and employee directory using dummy data. All of the nonsensitive data is displayed (username, first and last name, username, photo, etc), and can be sorted with the search bar, which finds employees based on first name, last name or username.

This was created with React, ReactStrap, random.me API, create-react-app, and Javascript and can be easily adapted as a front-end for a useable employee database application.

To test it out, clone the repo, run "npm install", and once the  api call is completed, you can search with the search bar at the top.
